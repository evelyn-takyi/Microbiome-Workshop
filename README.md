# Microbiome-Workshop

## Amplicon Data Analysis

## Welcome

Welcome to 16S microbiome data analysis

## Introduction
This workshop provides an overview of the bioinformatics workflow in taxonomic profiling studies. The training material walks you through an example workflow that shows the standard steps of taxonomic data analysis covering data processing, exploration, analysis, visualization. At the end of the training,you will become familiar with standard bioinformatics concepts and methods in taxonomic profiling studies of microbiome data.

### To dos prior to attending workshop

A. Please download R and RStudio and install it on your computer 
- [Download R](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu) 
- [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

B.Before coming to the workshop, read these papers
-

C. Come with a fully charged laptop

D. - No prior experience with microbiome data or R is required. Familiarity with R is a plus!.



### What is covered in this workshop
```
- This workshop provides a concise introduction to conducting the statistical analysis and visualising microbiome data in R based on metabarcoding and highthroughput sequencing.
- The analysis is starting with processing raw sequencing data to data visualization.
```
### Agenda
```
1. Introduction to microbiome data analysis.(20minutes Powerpoint presentation)
2. Introduction to data analysis in QIIME2
3. Hands on practice with data analysis and visualization in R
```

### Data sets used in this tutorial
```
For this tutorial We will be looking at data from my research work.
The study was looking at the effect of probiotic S4 formulation on microbial community of larvae raised in UV and non-UV water from a hatchery. We collected larval samples, sequenced the 16S V6 region. We will be analyzing this data in different tools and try to interpret the results.
