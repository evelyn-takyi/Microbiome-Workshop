# Microbiome-Workshop

## Amplicon Data Analysis

## Welcome
```
Welcome to Analysis of 16S microbiome data
```
### To dos prior to attending workshop
```
A. Come with a fully charged laptop
B. Download R studio onto your computer
C. Before coming to the workshop, read these papers:
```


### What is covered in this workshop
```
- This workshop provides a concise introduction to conducting the statistical analysis and visualising microbiome data in R based on metabarcoding and highthroughput sequencing.
- No prior experience with microbiome data or R is required. Familiarity with command line tools and R is a plus!.
- The analysis is starting with processing raw sequencing data to data visualization.
```
### Agenda
```
1. Introduction to microbiome data analysis.(20minutes Powerpoint presentation)
2. Introduction to data analysis in QIIME2
3. Hands on practice with data analysis and visualization in R
```

### Data sets used in this tutorial
```
For this tutorial We will be looking at data from my research work.
The study was looking at the effect of probiotic S4 formulation on microbial community of larvae raised in UV and non-UV water from a hatchery. We collected larval samples, sequenced the 16S V6 region. We will be analyzing this data in different tools and try to understand the results.
```
### Analysis of the data will be in two parts
#### Part1
```
First part of the analysis will be done on the bluewaves cluster in the terminal window on your laptop
To connect to bluewaves, contact Kevin Bryan in statistics department(bryank@uri.edu) 
```
#### Part2
```
Second part of the analysis will be done with R statistical software.
```
### Software used in this workshop
```
- QIIME2
- Dada2
- R/R studio
```
